Hi, I am Dequn Teng, a computer science and electronic engineering student in EEE department, and I am expected to go to the University of Cambridge, Institute for manufacturing, department of engineering focusing on business model innovation research group. The topic of today is Why the Liverpool campus is a good option for study and live using my personal true experience.

# study

## general study

- Firstly, It is because that it provides high standard academic integrity training supported by lecturers and professors with high academic achievements and innovative teaching approach. For example, Professor Hall concentrates to electronic system for more than 30 years, and Dr. Waleed applies innovative interactive teaching approach in decomposing complex concepts into intuitions familiar with everyday life. It is the high academic standard that equips students with high reputations worldwide, especially in graduate studies.

- Secondly, graduates from CSEE major can go to prestigious universities worldwide such as the University of Cambridge, Imperial College, UCL, University of Michigan Ann Arbor，Duke University, Northeastern University, Washington University （St. Louis），University of California San Diego, These graduate studies program are so widely recognized by high tech companies and higher research institutes.

- Thirdly, Liverpool is such a lovely city welcoming us students. It is truly warm-hearted people that will make you feel at home, and here you will not feel lovely since the Chinese features are also a part of the local Liverpool life.

## final year project

- I personally have a self-raised project
- weekly contact
- Professor katie
- learn the techniques
- do the demonstrations
- write the proposal
- Hear from feedbacks
- my proposal is directly the same as the one I used for the graduate studies at university of cambridge

# Apart from the academic life

## travel

My personal life at University of Liverpool is also very meaningful. Basically, after a week's learning, I will go to have a travel to different cities in UK. During my studies at UK. I went to Manchester, York, Leeds, Nortingham, London, North Ireland, Edingburgh, Glasgows, Blackpool. Basically, I ride my bike to the train station, buy a train ticket with a ticket discount, get my bike researved at the train station. 

- arrive at city
- travel at the city
- go back home
- take another day for studying, 
- Work and life balance

## Environment

In terms of the Covid-19 issues, UK has the highest Vaccination rate, which is more than 55%, as mentioned in the previous lectures. What is more, the culture here at University is generally stable, compared with the conflicts at America. 



That is why I think Liverpool Campus is a good option for study the CSEE area.
